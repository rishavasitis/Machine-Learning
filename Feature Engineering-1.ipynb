    "Q1: Filter Method in Feature Selection\n",
    "- The Filter method is a feature selection technique that filters out irrelevant or redundant features based on statistical measures or domain knowledge.\n",
    "- How it works: Features are ranked or scored independently of the machine learning algorithm. Common metrics include correlation, chi-squared, information gain, and mutual information. Features are selected or ranked based on their scores, and the top-ranked features are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Difference between Filter and Wrapper Methods\n",
    "- Wrapper methods evaluate feature subsets by training and testing models with different feature combinations. They consider the interaction between features and can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "- Filter methods, as mentioned earlier, evaluate features independently of the machine learning algorithm and are computationally less demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Embedded Feature Selection Methods\n",
    "- Embedded methods select or eliminate features as part of the model training process. Common techniques include:\n",
    "  - L1 Regularization (Lasso): Encourages sparsity by driving some feature coefficients to zero.\n",
    "  - Tree-based algorithms (e.g., Random Forest): Assess feature importance during training.\n",
    "  - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Iteratively removes the least significant features based on model performance.\n",
    "  - Feature Importance from Gradient Boosting: Assess feature importance from gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Drawbacks of Filter Method\n",
    "- Filter methods do not consider the interactions between features.\n",
    "- They might filter out relevant features that have strong interactions with other features.\n",
    "- Filter methods rely on pre-defined criteria, which may not be optimal for a specific machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: When to Use Filter Method over Wrapper Method\n",
    "- Use the Filter method when you have a large number of features and you want a quick initial selection of potentially relevant features.\n",
    "- It's efficient for filtering out highly irrelevant features before applying more computationally expensive wrapper methods.\n",
    "- Filter methods are suitable when the relationship between individual features and the target variable is apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Using Filter Method in Telecom Customer Churn Project\n",
    "- Calculate feature scores (e.g., correlation, chi-squared, mutual information) with the target variable (churn).\n",
    "- Select the features with the highest scores, indicating the most relevant attributes for predicting customer churn.\n",
    "- This quick feature selection helps narrow down the candidate attributes for building predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Using Embedded Method in Soccer Match Outcome Prediction\n",
    "- Train a machine learning model (e.g., gradient boosting) on the soccer match dataset.\n",
    "- Assess feature importance from the trained model, which reveals which player statistics and team rankings contribute most to match outcomes.\n",
    "- Select the most important features for the prediction model based on their feature importances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: Using Wrapper Method in House Price Prediction\n",
    "- Employ a wrapper method like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).\n",
    "- Train a model with the limited set of features and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "- Recursively eliminate less significant features and retrain the model until optimal performance is achieved.\n",
    "- The final set of features retained by RFE represents the most important attributes for predicting house prices."
