    "Q1: Data Encoding in Data Science\n",
    "- Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data (text-based labels or categories) into numerical format, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- Useful in Data Science: Data encoding allows algorithms to work with categorical data, which is essential for building predictive models. It transforms non-numeric attributes into a format that algorithms can understand and process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Nominal Encoding\n",
    "- Nominal encoding is a technique to convert categorical data into unique numerical codes. Each category is assigned a specific numeric value.\n",
    "- Example: In a real-world scenario, consider a dataset with a \"color\" column containing values like \"red,\" \"blue,\" and \"green.\" You can assign numeric codes, e.g., \"red\" as 1, \"blue\" as 2, and \"green\" as 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: When to Prefer Nominal Encoding over One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "- Nominal encoding is preferred when there is an inherent order or ranking within the categories.\n",
    "- Practical Example: In a survey dataset with a \"customer satisfaction\" column, you might encode \"very dissatisfied\" as 1, \"dissatisfied\" as 2, and so on, representing the ordinal nature of the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Choosing an Encoding Technique for 5 Unique Values\n",
    "- For a dataset with 5 unique categorical values, you can choose nominal encoding when there's an order among these values. If there's no inherent order, one-hot encoding is suitable.\n",
    "- Explanation: If the categories represent, for example, product ratings from \"low\" to \"high,\" nominal encoding is appropriate. If the categories represent different product types, one-hot encoding would be better to avoid implying any ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Calculating New Columns for Nominal Encoding\n",
    "- If you use nominal encoding on two categorical columns, you'll create new columns equal to the number of unique categories in those columns.\n",
    "- Example: If you have a \"color\" column with 5 unique values and a \"size\" column with 3 unique values, nominal encoding would create 5 + 3 = 8 new columns in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Encoding for Animal Dataset\n",
    "- For an animal dataset with categorical attributes like \"species,\" \"habitat,\" and \"diet,\" you'd typically use nominal encoding.\n",
    "- Justification: These categorical attributes do not have a natural order or ranking, so nominal encoding is suitable. It assigns unique codes to each category for use in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Encoding for Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "- To transform categorical data into numerical data for the customer churn prediction project, you can use label encoding or ordinal encoding for the \"contract type\" and \"gender\" columns.\n",
    "- Step-by-Step Explanation:\n",
    "  1. Use label encoding to assign numeric labels to \"gender\" (e.g., \"male\" as 0, \"female\" as 1).\n",
    "  2. Use ordinal encoding for \"contract type\" if there is a natural order (e.g., \"month-to-month\" as 0, \"one year\" as 1, \"two years\" as 2).\n",
    "  3. For \"monthly charges\" and \"tenure,\" no encoding is needed, as they are already numeric."
