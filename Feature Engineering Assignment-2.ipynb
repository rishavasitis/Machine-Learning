    "Q1: Min-Max Scaling\n",
    "- Min-Max scaling is a feature scaling technique used in data preprocessing to transform numerical features to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Formula: Scaled Value = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)\n",
    "- Example: Scaling a feature \"price\" in a food delivery dataset. If the price ranges from $5 to $20, and you want to scale it to a 0-1 range:\n",

    "- Unit Vector scaling, also known as normalization, scales features to have a unit norm (length).\n",
    "- It differs from Min-Max scaling because it scales features to unit length, making them fall on a unit hypersphere.\n",
    "- Example: Normalizing a feature vector [3, 4]:\n",

    "Q4: Relationship between PCA and Feature Extraction\n",
    "- PCA can be used for feature extraction by transforming the original features into a new set of features (principal components) that capture the most significant information.\n",

    "Q5: Using Min-Max Scaling in a Food Delivery Recommendation System\n",
    "- Min-Max scaling can be applied to features like \"price,\" \"rating,\" and \"delivery time\" to ensure they are on a consistent scale.\n",
